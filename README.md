# Reddit-Laughs-2019
Just a Tableau Dashboard for Reddit laugh comments 2019. 
I aimed to capture the most popular laugh comments made on reddit through this small project. 
This project is not in any way commercial and was only made for fun and exploration of tableau.

Expansion of the Project:
Thinking about linking videos to the laughs,
maybe adding some background and other stylistic elements.


The Data:
The data is taken from a different github account https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/laugh, it's not owned by me
I don't take credit for it. And it is entirely obtained through The Pudding'.
